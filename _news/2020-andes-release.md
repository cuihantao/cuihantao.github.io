ANDES Version 1.0.0 Released

***
The power system simulator ANDES that I developed as part of the CURENT LTB has been publicly announced on PowerGlobe.

Checkout the ANDES source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuihantao/andes) and the documentation on [andes.readthedocs.io](https://andes.readthedocs.io), which has a tutorial for getting started.

The paper that describes the implemented hybrid symbolic-numeric framework has been accepted by _IEEE Transactions on Power System_.
See [IEEExplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169830) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09455).
Please cite our paper in the publications derived from the use of ANDES.

The announcement email with more details is available on [PowerGlobe Archive](https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=POWER-GLOBE;4e9f3fe6.2005D&S=).
