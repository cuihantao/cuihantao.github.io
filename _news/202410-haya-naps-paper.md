title: Paper "Impact of Reordering on the LU Factorization Performance of Bordered Block-Diagonal Sparse Matrix" accepted at NAPS 2024
---


Our paper titled "Impact of Reordering on the LU Factorization Performance of
Bordered Block-Diagonal Sparse Matrix" has been accepted for the 2024 North
American Power Symposium (NAPS). This paper identifies that the factorization of
BBD matrices can be accelerated by turning off the reordering algorithm.
Congratulations to my former PhD student [Haya
Monawwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haya-monawwar-732906217/) at Oklahoma
State University for the leading efforts.

This paper is coauthored with Dr. Jonathan Maack and Dr. Min Xiong at National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. We also want to thank the support from Dr. Jin Tan
and Dr. Andy Hoke at NREL. 

Ahmad Ali presented this paper at NAPS 2024 in El Paso, TX.
