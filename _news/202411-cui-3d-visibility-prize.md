title: Dr. Cui's Team Wins Runner-Up in DOE's 3D Solar Visibility Competition!

---

I’m proud to share that my team, GoBugFree, is a runner-up in the
3DSolarVisibility Prize by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the American-Made
Program! The team was awarded $25,000 for creating one of the most accurate
algorithms and tools in the competition to detect how much solar power is in the
electricity grid at a given point in time. By creating a noteworthy tool, my
team is playing a small part in catalyzing research and development on grid
modernization. More specifically, our work enables utility companies and grid
operators to make better informed decisions that optimize the distribution of
solar energy technologies. 

Our tool, along with other competitors’, were tested daily over a two-week
period in two distribution networks through the publicly available, open-source
data and software platform, Open Energy Data Initiative Solar Integration (OEDI
SI). The OEDI SI team then compared participants’ performance against a set of
industry standard metrics and selected GoBugFree as a top-performing team. Check
