title: Cui receives the NSF CAREER Award.
---

It is my great honor to have received the 2024 NSF CAREER award during my third
year at Oklahoma State University. In this project, I will investigate unified
modeling, simulation, and analysis of multi-timescale power systems.

Significance: The project will lay the foundation for characterizing fast
electromagnetic transients and slow yet large-scale electromechanical dynamics
in one unified framework, achieving a balance between granularity and
computational efficiency.

Education: The education component includes developing a power system dynamics
tutorial emphasizing the control and impact of converters. I will develop solar
energy kits for engineering outreach.

I am grateful to my mentors at OSU, CURENT, and PSERC, as well as my
collaborators and friends, for their invaluable input. My special thanks to the
NSF Energy, Power, Control, and Networks (EPCN) program for funding this
project.
