title: CyberTraining project funded by National Science Foundation.
---

Dr. Cui is grateful to receive an NSF award to develop computational training
materials for power engineering researchers. This work is in collaboration with
Dr. Xin Fang at Mississippi State University. The project is titled
"Collaborative Research: CyberTraining: Pilot: PowerCyber: Computational
Training for Power Engineering Researchers".

In this project, the investigators will develop an online, modular, and openly
available PowerCyber training to prepare power engineering researchers with a
comprehensive understanding of advanced CI software, hardware, and emerging CI
technologies. The tasks include a) developing high-quality, interactive, and
on-demand training modules to cover advanced CI in software, hardware, and
emerging techniques and demonstrating, by research examples, their potential to
transform power engineering research; b) offering virtual PowerCyber training
workshops; and c) incorporating the training materials into the curricula at the
home institution of the investigator. Upon the completion of this project, we
expect to have demonstrated a pilot training workshop that provides researchers
with advanced CI capabilities for solving power-domain problems.
