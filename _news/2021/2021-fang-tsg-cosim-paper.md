Our paper titled "Transmission-and-Distribution Dynamic Co-Simulation Framework for Distributed Energy Resource Frequency Response"
is published in the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid. The collaboration with NREL creates a Transmission-Distribution co-simulation
platform. See [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05894) or [IEEEXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9569771).
