Jinning Wang's paper titled "Dynamics-incorporated Modeling Framework for Stability Constrained Scheduling Under High-penetration of Renewable Energy" has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy. Jinning developed a new tool called [AMS](https://github.com/curent/ams) that seamlessly integrates with ANDES to perform dispatch-dynamics co-simulations. AMS also has numerous improvements over existing optimization frameworks -- please check out the GitHub repository!

Congratulations to Jinning and the CURENT Large Scale Testbed team!!
