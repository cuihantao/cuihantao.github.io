title: Paper "Pathway Toward an Open Source Ecosystem in Power Systems" published in IEEE Electrification Magazine
---

Our latest article "Pathway Toward an Open Source Ecosystem in Power Systems: A
blueprint for collaborative innovation and software sustainability" has been
published in the IEEE Electrification Magazine. 

This work explores how open-source development can drive innovation,
cost-effectiveness, and adaptability in power grid software. It also proposes a
sustainable business model that aligns commercial and community interests.

We conducted extensive interviews with stakeholders in the power industry. The
work is led by Ahmad Ali and Junjie Yin. We are grateful for the support for Dr.
Robin Podmore. We also thank the guest editor, Dr. Lingling Fan, for the
opportunity to present this work in IEEE Electrification Magazine.

This work is supported by the NSF TIP POSE project titled "POSE: Phase I: Toward
an Open-Source Ecosystem for Power Systems Research, Education, and Industry
Applications".
