title: PowerCyber Training is now available at https://powerct.eecps.com
---

After over a year of development, PowerCyber Training is now available at
https://powerct.eecps.com. The current materials introduce Linux-based
environments and Python programming language to power system students and
engineers. 

Five modules have been developed: computational environments, Python and data
analytics, numerical methods, optimization, and transmission-distribution
simulation. Many of the lessons are adopted from our research work. The Jupyter
Notebooks for replicating the results are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PowerCyberTraining/powercybertraining.github.io).

We encourage you to register and enjoy the training, but anonymous browsing is
also available. We welcome your feedback and suggestions.

This work is supported by the NSF Award #2514757 titled "Collaborative Research:
CyberTraining: Pilot: PowerCyber: Computational Training for Power Engineering
Researchers". The project is a collaboration between Dr. Cui (NC State) and Dr.
Xin Fang (University of South Carolina).
