Dr. Cui is grateful to receive the funding from NSF for the project proposal
titled "HyperTran: High-Performance Transient Stability Simulation of Power
Systems on Modern Parallel Computing Hardware". The proposed framework will
bring transformative changes to the understanding of how power system models
should be represented and how computational workflows should be structured to
take advantage of modern parallel computers.
