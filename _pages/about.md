Hantao Cui is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
North Carolina State University. Prior to joining NC State, he was an Assistant
Professor at Oklahoma State University from 2021 to 2024. He earned his Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (2018),
following his M.S. (2013) and B.S. (2011) in the same field from Southeast
University, China. He received the NSF CAREER Award in 2024. Previously, he
served as the Chief Technologist of the [CURENT](https://curent.utk.edu)
Large-Scale Testbed (LTB), a winner of the 2020 R&D 100 Awards. He is the Chair
of the [IEEE PES Computer and Analytical Methods Subcommittee
(CAMS)](https://cmte.ieee.org/pes-cams/) and has been an Associate Editor of the
[Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy](http://www.mpce.info) since 2019.
He is a Senior Member of the IEEE.

Dr. Cui leads the Power CyberInfrastructure (PowerCI) Lab at NC State, where his
research focuses on the computational structure and fundamental limits of
dynamic power systems with high penetration of converters and data center loads.
His work emphasizes principled modeling and analysis frameworks that treat
computation as a scientific instrument for studying stability, controllability,
and system behavior under new challenges. These efforts have produced
foundational insights into large scale dynamic simulation and system stability,
clarifying the interplay among computation, modeling fidelity, and control
design. His research has been published in leading venues including Proceedings
of the IEEE, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Smart
Grid, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, and Nature Communications.

The PowerCI Lab develops and maintains research software infrastructure and
training materials that support its work on power system modeling, simulation,
and analysis. These include [ANDES](https://github.com/curent/andes), a Python
based framework for dynamic power system modeling and large scale simulation, as
well as computational training materials developed through projects such as
[Power CyberTraining](https://powerct.eecps.com).

The PowerCI Lab actively partners with utilities, renewable energy developers,
system operators, and technology companies on industry focused research and
consulting for grid modernization. The lab conducts custom studies and
collaborative research on topics such as dynamic modeling and simulation,
inverter dominated grid stability, wide area monitoring, and computational
performance of power system analysis tools. Industry engagements are designed to
address real world challenges while grounding solutions in rigorous modeling,
analysis, and validation.
