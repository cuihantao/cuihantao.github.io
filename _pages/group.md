  - title: Research Mission
    content: >
      The GridCI Lab develops open-source computational tools and methods for next-generation power systems. 
      Through projects like ANDES and PowerCyber Training, we create accessible, reproducible, and efficient 
      platforms that serve both power system research and education.

    content: >
      Our research bridges power systems with advanced computation:

      - **High-Performance Power System Analytics**: We develop symbolic-numeric methods and parallel computing 
        algorithms to accelerate power system simulation. Our ANDES platform (4000+ commits) provides an 
        open-source foundation for research reproducibility.

      - **Digital Twins for Power Electronics-Dominated Grids**: We build real-time simulation models combining 
        testbeds with advanced numerical methods, enabling high-fidelity studies of converter-grid interactions.

      - **AI-Enhanced Grid Operation**: We integrate physics-based modeling with machine learning to address 
        emerging challenges in renewable integration, EV charging, and data center power management.

      - **Research Software Engineering**: We create open-source tools and educational platforms (PowerCyber) 
        that make advanced power system analysis accessible to researchers and students.

      We welcome students with a genuine interest in electrical engineering and computer software who are self-motivated. Successful candidates typically have backgrounds in power systems, power electronics, control, and automation, along with a solid math foundation and demonstrable programming skills. Knowledge of machine learning is a plus. Contact Dr. Cui with your CV and research interests, highlighting relevant experience.


      The GridCI Lab is part of the [NC State ECE Department](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/). Prospective students should apply through the department's graduate admissions process.


      ### Ph.D. Students
      
      - **Domestic students (U.S. permanent resident or citizen)**: We strongly encourage you to email Dr. Cui before applying, discussing your research interests and qualifications.

      - **International students**: While we appreciate your interest, due to the high volume of emails, we may not be able to respond to all inquiries. Please apply directly to the [NC State ECE graduate program](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/grad/). Students with a M.S. degree is preferred, but we will consider highly motivated students with bachelor's degrees.


      ### M.S. Students

      
      Research positions are available, but funding is limited for international students. For domestic NC State MS-EPSE students interested in research, there may be potential for funding. Please reach out to discuss opportunities.


      ### Undergraduate Researchers

      
      We always have positions available for motivated undergraduates. Please email Dr. Cui to schedule a meeting and discuss potential projects.


      ### Postdoctoral Scholars
      
      We seek candidates with a strong publication record in power system stability, dynamics, simulation, and related fields. Our focus is on quality research that advances the field, not just quantity of papers. If you have a passion for rigorous, impactful work, please contact Dr. Cui with your CV and research statement.
