  - title: Research Mission
    content: >
      The PowerCI Lab develops open-source computational tools and methods for next-generation power systems. 
      Through projects like ANDES and PowerCyber Training, we create accessible, reproducible, and efficient 
      platforms that serve both power system research and education.

      Our research bridges power systems with advanced computation:

      - **High-Performance Power System Analytics**: We develop symbolic-numeric methods and parallel computing 
        algorithms to accelerate power system simulation. Our ANDES platform (4000+ commits) provides an 
        open-source foundation for research reproducibility.

      - **Digital Twins for Power Electronics-Dominated Grids**: We build real-time simulation models combining 
        testbeds with advanced numerical methods, enabling high-fidelity studies of converter-grid interactions.

      - **AI-Enhanced Grid Operation**: We integrate physics-based modeling with machine learning to address 
        emerging challenges in renewable integration, EV charging, and data center power management.

      - **Research Software Engineering**: We create open-source tools and educational platforms (PowerCyber) 
        that make advanced power system analysis accessible to researchers and students.

      We welcome students with a genuine interest in electrical engineering and computer software who are self-motivated. Successful candidates typically have backgrounds in power systems, power electronics, control, and automation, along with a solid math foundation and demonstrable programming skills. Knowledge of machine learning is a plus. Contact Dr. Cui with your CV and research interests, highlighting relevant experience.


      The PowerCI Lab is part of the [NC State ECE Department](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/). Prospective students should apply through the department's graduate admissions process.


      ### Ph.D. Students
      
      - **Domestic students (U.S. permanent resident or citizen)**: We encourage you to reach out to Dr. Cui to discuss your research interests and background before applying. This helps ensure alignment with our lab's focus areas.


      - **International students**: We welcome applications through the [NC State ECE graduate program](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/grad/). While we receive many inquiries and may not respond to all emails, we carefully review all complete applications. Candidates with M.S. degrees are preferred, though exceptional students with bachelor's degrees are also considered.



      ### M.S. Students

      
      Research positions are available, but funding is limited for international students. For domestic NC State MS-EPSE students interested in research, there may be potential for funding. Please reach out to discuss opportunities.


      ### Undergraduate Researchers

      
      We always have positions available for motivated undergraduates. Please email Dr. Cui to schedule a meeting and discuss potential projects.


      ### Postdoctoral Scholars
      
      We welcome candidates with demonstrated research experience in power system stability, dynamics, simulation, and related fields. Our lab values rigorous, innovative work that advances the field and creates lasting impact. If you are passionate about developing next-generation power system solutions and share our commitment to excellence, please contact Dr. Cui with your CV and research statement.
