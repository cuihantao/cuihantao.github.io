This work is in collaboration with Dr. Xin Fang at Mississippi State University.</p> <p>In this project, the investigators will develop an online, modular, and openly available PowerCyber training to prepare power engineering researchers with a comprehensive understanding of advanced CI software, hardware, and emerging CI technologies. The tasks include a) developing high-quality, interactive, and on-demand training modules to cover advanced CI in software, hardware, and emerging techniques and demonstrating, by research examples, their potential to transform power engineering research; b) offering virtual PowerCyber training workshops; and c) incorporating the training materials into the curricula at the home institution of the investigator. Upon the completion of this project, we expect to have demonstrated a pilot training workshop that provides researchers with advanced CI capabilities for solving power-domain problems.</p> <p>The project abstract can be found at https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226826.</p> </body></html>
